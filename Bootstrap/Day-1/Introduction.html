    <!-- Bootstrap is a CSS Framework which is used to create responsive web applications (or) websites -->
    <!-- Responsiveness means that our website should work and show correctly/properly in any screen size -->
    <!-- Bootstrap has already pre-defined classes and tags for our webpage to be responsive -->
    <!-- We have to include the Bootstrap to our webpage -->
    <!-- https://getbootstrap.com/ -->
    <!-- Two ways to integrate-> Local Integration and Server Integration -->
    <!-- As for the local integration, download Bootstrap 5-> CSS-> Link bootstrap.css into this html page -->
    <!-- For server integration, go to-> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/ -->
    <!-- And then copy the CDN via jsDelivr links into head tag -->
    <!-- Always note that local integration is faster than server integration -->
