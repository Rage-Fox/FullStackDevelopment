    <!-- ID Selector will be used with the help of '#' character inside the style tag or else in the external css file -->
    <!-- You cannot give an id name starting with number/digits. You always have to start it with alphabets only! -->
    <!-- Difference between class selector and id selector is that id is unique for the entire page, meaning that it has to be used for a single time, but class can be used multiple number of times! -->
    <!-- ID selector is also used for navigation to specific sections for single page applications/websites -->
