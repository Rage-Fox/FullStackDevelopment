There are two types of GitHub:
1) Centralized Version Control System(Old)
2) Distributed Version Control System(New)
***********************************************************
Disadvantage in Centralized Version Control System is that if a user is directly connected to cloud/repository, then if there is any issue while uploading, that information/code/packet will be destroyed and lost.
In Distributed Version Control System, user will be connected to local GitHub repository(".git" which will be saved in our system at our end) and that will be connected to cloud. So, even if there is any issues in the middle, the local GitHub repository will store this information/cloud/packet. So the packet will be safe from getting destroyed!
***********************************************************
Default branch in GitHub is "main", which acts like a root of the entire data tree!

Connecting a specific branch:
    git branch -M "branch name"
To establish connection between our laptop and the remote GitHub cloud:
    git remote add origin "github repo http link .git"
Pushing into GitHub remote cloud through the mentioned branch name:
    git push -u origin "branch name"
Deleting .git created in our laptop/local repository:
    rm -rf .git
Removing connection between local repo and remote repo:
    git remote remove origin
To download another person's full GitHub files/repository into our local system:
