    <!-- JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions -->
    <!-- JavaScript is a scripting language which looks and feels like other programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Java -->
    <!-- But JavaScript varies in it's syntax. It is used to perform tasks and clickable events for a webpage. It is very much important aspect in the field web development -->
    <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
    <!-- You can write JS in two ways: Internal and External(".js" extension) -->
    <!-- Everytime you have to write JavaScript internally, we have to write it's code in <script></script> tags. -->
