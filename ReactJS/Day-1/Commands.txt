With Internet:
After installing NodeJs, check whether it has installed correctly using two commands in command prompt as "nodejs -v" and "npm -v"
We have to open folder in the file explorer and then open command prompt from there.
Then enter "code ." to open that particular folder in Visual Studio Code
Then open terminal in VS Code using "Ctrl+Shift+`" and then enter the following commands:
-> npm install -g create-react-app
-> npx create-react-app appname(app/project name has to be in lowercase)
-> Move to that specific app folder using "cd appnamefolder"
-> npm cache clean --force
-> npm start

Without Internet:
-> Extract zip file in "Default File" Folder
-> Open VS code and open that Folder
-> Then, you have to give two commands "npm install" and "npm start"
